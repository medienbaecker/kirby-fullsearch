# Kirby ->fullsearch()

This is a replacement for the native [->search()](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/objects/pages/search) method.

The only difference: if you're searching for `"the keyword"` only pages which contain `"the keyword"` will be in the results. Not all pages that contain `"the"` or `"keyword"`.
